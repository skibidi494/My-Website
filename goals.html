                for them, and making sure they are being treated right. Before letting people adopt our Dachshunds, we always
                do a house inspection and have an interview with the owners to make sure our puppies are going to good homes.
                We hope that if dogs, not just Dachshunds, go to good homes, they will be treated better, making their behaviors
                more lively and happy! Dogs for LIFE!
